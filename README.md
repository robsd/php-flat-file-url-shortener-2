# php-flat-file-url-shortener-2 ðŸ”—

Another flat file URL shortener written in PHP which uses a slightly different URL shortage method.

## Getting setup

1. [Download](https://github.com/robsd/php-flat-file-url-shortener-2/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract this repo.
3. Edit the **urls.txt** file with the URLs you wish to shorten in the format `example => https://example.com` (one per line) where **example** is the end part e g. **yourdomain.com/example** and **https://example.com** is the link you wish to shorten.
4. Upload everything to your PHP-enabled web server.

## Need a hint?

I have created an example shortened URL in **urls.txt** based on the above setup guide.
